                <h2>Yakutian Climate</h2>
                <p>Yakutia is known for its climate extremes, with the Verkhoyansk Range being the coldest area in the
                    Northern Hemisphere. Some of the lowest natural temperatures ever recorded have been here.</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The Northern Hemisphere's Pole of Cold is at Verkhoyansk, where the temperatures reached as low as
                    −67.8 °C (−90.0 °F) in 1892, and at Oymyakon, where the temperatures reached as low as −71.2 °C
                    (−96.2 °F) in January 1924.

                <h2>Yakutian Food</h2>
                <p>
                    Sakha cuisine generally relies heavily on
                    dairy products, meat, fish, and foraged goods.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Food is generally prepared through boiling (meat, fish), fermentation (kumis, suorat), or freezing
                    (meat, fish).

                <p>
                    Sakha people celebrate the New Year twice a year – in winter with the rest of citizens of Russia,
                    and in summer – according to the ancient traditions.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The Sakha Yhyakh festival (literally meaning "abundance") is related to a cult of a solar deity,
                    with a fertility cult.
