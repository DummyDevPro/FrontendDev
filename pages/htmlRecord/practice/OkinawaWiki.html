    Okinawa was officially founded in 1879 by the <a href="">Empire of Japan</a> after seven years as the <a href="">Ryukyu Domain</a>, 
    the last domain of the <a href="">Han system</a>. 
    Okinawa was occupied by the United States during the Allied <a href="">occupation of Japan</a> after <a href="">World War II</a> and was 
    governed by the <a href="">Military Government of Ryukyu Islands</a> from 1945 to 1950 and <a href="">Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands</a> from 
    1950 until the prefecture was returned to Japan in 1972. 
    Okinawa comprises just 0.6 percent of Japan`s total land mass, but about 26,000 (75%) of <a href="">United States Forces Japan</a> personnel are assigned 
    to the prefecture; the continued <a href="">U.S. military presence in Okinawa</a> is contoversial.<sup><a href="">[3][4]</a></sup>
